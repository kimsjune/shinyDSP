	abstract = {To gain a better understanding of the complexity of gene expression in normal and diseased tissues it is important to account for the spatial context and identity of cells in situ. State-of-the-art spatial profiling technologies, such as the Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP), now allow quantitative spatially resolved measurement of the transcriptome in tissues. However, the bioinformatics pipelines currently used to analyse GeoMx data often fail to successfully account for the technical variability within the data and the complexity of experimental designs, thus limiting the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis. Carefully designed quality control workflows, that include in-depth experiment-specific investigations into technical variation and appropriate adjustment for such variation can address this issue. Here, we present standR, an R/Bioconductor package that enables an end-to-end analysis of GeoMx DSP data. With four case studies from previously published experiments, we demonstrate how the standR workflow can enhance the statistical power of GeoMx DSP data analysis and how the application of standR enables scientists to develop in-depth insights into the biology of interest.},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},
